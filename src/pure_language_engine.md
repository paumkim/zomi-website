# The Pure Language Engine

## Why Your Zomi Model Doesn't Need to Know the Date

Most AI models are built to be **generalists** — they know facts, dates, math, science, and how to cook eggs. But when you're building for a specific language, most of that is waste.

This page explains the philosophy behind a **Pure Language Engine** — a model designed to master one language deeply rather than many languages poorly.

## The Problem with General Models

A typical large language model like GPT-4 or Claude has to split its brain across thousands of skills:

```
General Model Brain:
├── World history (Egypt, Rome, WW2...)
├── Science (physics, chemistry, biology...)
├── Mathematics (algebra, calculus...)
├── Geography (capitals, rivers, mountains...)
├── Popular culture (movies, music, games...)
├── Safety guidelines and ethics
├── Conversation skills (how to be helpful)
├── Date and time awareness (what day is it?)
├── Multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Zomi...)
├── Reasoning (logic chains, problem solving)
└── And thousands more...
```

A 70B+ parameter model can *barely* fit all this. Smaller models? They're stretched thin. A 7B model trying to know everything ends up knowing nothing well.

---

## The Pure Language Engine Alternative

Instead of building a generalist, build a **specialist**. A model that does one thing — understand and generate a specific language — and does it perfectly.

```
Pure Zomi Language Engine:
├── Zomi grammar (SOV word order)
├── Zomi vocabulary (roots, affixes, compounds)
├── Zomi particles (in, pen, tawh, te, ah)
├── Zomi merge rules (paai ding → paaiding)
├── Zomi sentence flow and rhythm
├── Zomi cultural expressions and idioms
└── Nothing else.
```

**No dates. No world capitals. No physics. No chat fluff.** Just the language.

## How It Works

A Pure Language Engine uses a **frozen base model** (like Qwen) as a foundation — providing the general "machinery" of language (tokenization, grammar patterns, sentence formation). Then a **LoRA adapter** is trained on top, specializing it to Zomi.

```
         ┌──────────────────────────┐
         │   Zomi LoRA Adapter      │  ← Trained in ~40 hours
         │   (3M lines of Zomi)     │  ← Cost: ~$60
         ├──────────────────────────┤
         │   Qwen Base (Frozen)     │  ← Pre-trained by experts
         │   (general language)     │  ← Cost: Millions (already paid)
         └──────────────────────────┘
```

This approach gives you:

**1. Faster training** — Only the adapter learns, not the whole model. 7% of parameters instead of 100%.

**2. Smaller footprint** — The adapter is ~900MB vs the full model at ~6GB. Swap adapters, keep the same base.

**3. Focused learning** — Every training step is about Zomi, not about world facts. No wasted compute.

**4. Easy iteration** — Want a Zomi tutor? Train a second adapter. Translation? Third adapter. All share the same Qwen brain.

## The Scaling Strategy

One frozen base model. Many specialized adapters. Swappable like apps on a phone.

```
         ┌────────────────────────────┐
         │      Qwen Base Model       │
         │      (Frozen Brain)        │
         └────────────┬───────────────┘
                      │
    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
    │                 │                  │
┌───▼────────┐  ┌────▼────────┐  ┌──────▼──────┐
│ Zomi Chat  │  │ Zomi Tutor │  │ Zomi→English│
│ Adapter    │  │ Adapter    │  │ Translation │
│ (this run) │  │ (future)   │  │ (future)    │
└────────────┘  └────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

Each adapter is a separate skill. The base model doesn't change. You load the adapter you need, use it, swap it out.

## What Your Model Will Know

When the current training run finishes, your model will:

```
✓ Complete Zomi sentences naturally
✓ Use correct SOV word order
✓ Apply proper particle attachments
✓ Merge words correctly (paai ding → paaiding)
✓ Understand Zomi cultural context
✗ NOT know what date it is
✗ NOT know who the US president is
✗ NOT know how to cook
✗ NOT know math beyond language patterns
```

And that's **perfect**. It doesn't need to know those things. It needs to speak Zomi. Everything else is optional features we can add later with additional adapters.

## Why This Matters for Low-Resource Languages

Most of the world's 7,000+ languages have limited digital presence. Training a general-purpose model for each one is impossible — it would cost billions.

But a **Pure Language Engine** approach makes it feasible:

| Resource | What's Needed | Cost |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Base model | Qwen or any open model | Free (open source) |
| Training data | 1M+ lines of text | Collection effort |
| Compute | 1x A100 for ~40 hours | ~$60 |
| Adapter storage | ~900MB per language | Negligible |

A language community can now build their own AI for the cost of a dinner out. That's the revolution.

## Built in Practice — The Zomi Proof

This model was trained during a 24-hour session between a human (Paumkim) and an AI agent, using:

- **Dataset:** 3,052,631 lines of Zomi text
- **Base model:** Qwen 2.5 3B
- **Method:** QLoRA rank 128
- **Hardware:** 1x A100 SXM4-80GB
- **Duration:** ~40 hours
- **Cost:** ~$60
- **Result:** The first Pure Zomi Language Engine

The dataset took months to collect. The training took one day. The adapter will last forever.

### Download the Model

When training completes, the model will be available on Hugging Face:

</p>

**Can I upload the full model to GitHub?** GitHub has a file size limit of 2GB per file and recommends Git LFS for larger files. The merged Zomi model is ~6GB, which works with Git LFS but is better suited for Hugging Face — it's built for models, offers free hosting, and lets people test the model right in their browser without downloading. The dataset, scripts, and everything else remain on GitHub.
